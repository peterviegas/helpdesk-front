            Hi! Welcome to the Help Desk system developed by me in the Full Stack Developer course.<br /> This is a ticket management system simulating a simple Help Desk developed in Angular 12 and Spring Boot 2. <br />The system is running in the cloud
            being the front on Vercel and the back on Heroku.<br /> The project's main objective is to approach the concepts of SPAs, Authentication and Authorization applications with JWT tokens and much more. The project's source code can be accessed
            by clicking on the Github link in the side menu.
            <br /><br /> Feel free to test the system and leave your suggestion.
            <br /> Yours sincerely: Peter Viegas
